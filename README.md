# Insufficient Error Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Dart code and its solution. The original code lacks robust error handling, while the solution shows how to properly handle exceptions for more resilient applications.

## Bug

The `bug.dart` file contains Dart code that fetches data from an API. The `catch` block only prints the error message. This is insufficient for production applications; a more robust approach is necessary for handling unexpected issues.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides an improved version of the code with a more comprehensive `catch` block. By re-throwing the exception, the error can be handled by a higher level function, which might include logging, retrying, fallback mechanisms, or user-facing error presentation.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Dart SDK installed.
3. Run the code using the Dart command line: `dart bug.dart` and `dart bugSolution.dart`

This example highlights the importance of comprehensive exception handling in Dart's asynchronous operations.
